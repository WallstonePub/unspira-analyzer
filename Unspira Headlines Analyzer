# Unspira Headlines Analyzer

### A Structured Method for Evaluating Headlines and Viral Claims

## Executive Summary

Public understanding of news is increasingly shaped by **headlines, viral claims, and short-form content**, rather than full reporting or primary sources. Traditional fact-checking approaches often fail in this environment because they rely on binary verdicts, opaque reasoning, or ideological framing.

The **Unspira Headlines Analyzer** defines a **structured, non-partisan analytical model** for evaluating headlines and viral claims using transparent criteria. Rather than declaring truth or falsehood, it decomposes claims into measurable dimensions—accuracy, framing, source credibility, consensus, and amplification—so readers can understand *what is known, what is missing, and why context matters*.

This paper describes the **analytical approach** behind the Headlines Analyzer. It does not disclose operational logic, scoring engines, or implementation details.

## The Problem: Headlines as Primary Information

In modern media ecosystems:

- Headlines are often consumed without full articles
- Viral framing frequently outpaces correction
- Emotion and urgency substitute for evidence
- Context is lost through compression

Binary fact-checks struggle under these conditions. A claim may be:

- technically accurate yet misleading
- incomplete yet widely shared
- novel yet prematurely dismissed
- amplified by unreliable actors

Unspira addresses this gap by treating **integrity as a spectrum**, not a verdict.

------

## Design Goals

The Headlines Analyzer is built around four goals:

1. **Clarity over persuasion**
   Outputs must explain reasoning, not compel belief.
2. **Non-binary evaluation**
   Claims are assessed across multiple dimensions rather than collapsed into “true” or “false.”
3. **Human readability**
   Results must be understandable without technical expertise.
4. **Transparency of method**
   Readers should be able to see *why* a conclusion was reached.

## Analytical Dimensions

The model evaluates claims using complementary analytical lenses:

- **Reality Check Matrix (RCM)**
  Examines factual accuracy, framing, tone, and transparency independently.
- **Source Evaluation**
  Assesses credibility based on institutional behavior, transparency, and historical reliability.
- **Impact–Confidence–Ease (ICE)**
  Weighs public significance, evidentiary strength, and comprehension cost.
- **Consensus Assessment**
  Measures agreement among credible outlets rather than popularity.
- **Social Amplification Review**
  Considers who is spreading the claim and how amplification affects perception.
- **Historical Source Classification**
  Distinguishes primary records from interpretive or symbolic narratives.

Each dimension addresses a known failure mode in headline-driven information environments.

------

## Handling Novelty and Uncertainty

Novel claims are neither accepted nor dismissed by default.

Instead:

- novelty increases evidentiary thresholds
- uncertainty is explicitly labeled
- missing data is identified rather than inferred

This prevents both premature validation and reflexive skepticism.

------

## Output Philosophy

The Headlines Analyzer produces:

- structured summaries
- contextual explanations
- plain-language verdict ranges

It does **not**:

- write editorials
- advocate positions
- speculate beyond evidence
- replace human judgment

------

## Availability Notice

This document describes the **analytical approach and design philosophy** of the Unspira Headlines Analyzer.
The underlying scoring systems, internal models, and operational logic are **not publicly released**.

------

## Conclusion

The Unspira Headlines Analyzer exists to help readers understand **how claims function**, not what they must believe.

By decomposing headlines into evidence, framing, consensus, and amplification, it restores context where compression has erased it.

Clarity, not authority, is the objective.
